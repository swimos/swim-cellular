/**
 * A Web Agent that represents a geographic region, and participates in a
 * hierarchical tree of nested regions.
 *
 * Region agents can cohabitate in the same Swim Node as other specialized
 * agents.  For example, the Swim Node with URI {@code /country/US/state/CA}
 * might run both a region agent and a RAN agent.  Think of a Swim Node like
 * an ultra lightweight Docker container, addressed by a URI.  And think of
 * Web Agents like hyper-virtualized processes that run in that container.
 *
 * Continuing the analogy, you can think of a Swim Node as having its own
 * sandboxed file system.  The &quot;files&quot; in a Swim Node container
 * are called Swim Lanes.  Swim Lanes, like OS files, can store data, and
 * be used as communication channels.  But unlike OS files, Swim Lanes have
 * strong cache coherence semantics.
 *
 * A Swim Downlink is a cache coherent handle to particular Swim Lane of some
 * other Swim Node.  Think of a Swim Link kind of like an open file descriptor
 * that can be coherently accessed and modified by remote agents.
 *
 * Swim Downlinks expose a locally materialized view of the remote state of
 * the linked-to lane.  Think of this behavior as similar to how a CPU mirrors
 * a subset of main memory into its L1 cache, with an asynchronous cache
 * coherency protocol that keeps the local cache eventually consistent with
 * main memory (i.e. the remote state of the linked-to lane).
